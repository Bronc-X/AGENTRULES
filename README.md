# Lotus

> Global Agent Rules — Lotus.
> Before, every new project meant repetitive prompt imports, skill setups, and wasted time — forgetting that *building* is the only reason to open your editor.
> Now, you have Lotus. Write your engineering "Constitution" once, and deploy it everywhere.
> Lotus: the smart Docker for managing your Agents globally.

Lotus continuously leverages the **latest, safest, and most stable global agent management mechanisms**. By applying these rules to your local AI tools' global configurations, Lotus governs the behavior of your AI agents across **all** your projects simultaneously — without ever needing to write repetitive prompt instructions or perform tedious per-project setups.

**Platform Compatibility:**

## 🧬 First Principles: Why Lotus Works

Stop chasing every flashy AI news headline. The anxiety is unnecessary.

At its core, every LLM—GPT, Claude, Gemini—is fundamentally doing one thing: converting your text into **high-dimensional vector embeddings**, processing them through transformer attention layers, and **predicting the most probable next token**. Understanding this single mechanism changes everything:

1. **Accuracy = Attention Precision**: The quality of AI output depends on how precisely the model's attention mechanism can lock onto your intent within the vector space. Lotus solves this by injecting **highly structured, unambiguous rules** that give the attention layers clear, high-signal targets. Vague prompts scatter attention; Lotus-formatted rules focus it like a laser.
2. **Context Window = The Only Bottleneck**: Every model has a finite context window. The real skill is not "knowing more prompts"—it's **managing what goes into that window**. Lotus uses a Hub-and-Spoke architecture to keep the global rules lean and universal, while project-specific details are layered separately, ensuring you never waste precious context tokens on redundant instructions.
3. **Persistence > Repetition**: Without Lotus, you re-explain your standards in every new chat session. With Lotus, your rules are **pre-loaded at the OS level** before the conversation even starts. The AI reads your constitution first, every time, automatically.

## ✨ Why Choose Lotus?

- 🧠 **Mindset Over Scripts**: Lotus teaches your AI *how to think* like a Senior Architect, PM, and QA. It enforces the "[GStack](https://github.com/jxnl/gstack) Workflow" (CEO Review -> Eng Review -> Code -> Global Review. Thanks to [GStack](https://github.com/jxnl/gstack) for the inspiration).
- 🌍 **Write Once, Run Everywhere**: A Single Source of Truth (`core/AGENTS.md`) automatically adapts and installs into Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and more.
- 🚧 **Zero Silent Failures**: Built-in quality gates guarantee your generated code includes proper user feedback, loading states, and aesthetic consistency.
- ⚡ **Seamless Wake-Up Calls (`@` and `/`)**: Summon specific expert personas and architectural overviews dynamically mid-chat using platform-native triggers.
- 🗑️ **Anti-Plugin Bloat**: 95% of plugins and skills on the market become stale junk within weeks. Lotus takes the opposite approach—every skill is **hand-curated, battle-tested, and minimally sufficient**. We only ship what survives real production workflows.
- 🔄 **Continuously Updated, Frontier-Tracked**: Lotus is a **living protocol**, not a static config dump. We actively track bleeding-edge releases from **Claude Code, Codex CLI, and top-tier open-source agent frameworks**, and fold the safest, most proven patterns back into `core/AGENTS.md` so your rules never go stale.
- 🧘 **Anti-Anxiety by Design**: New frameworks every week? Another "game-changing" plugin? Relax. LLMs are vector-based word predictors. The only things that actually matter are **vector precision** (clear rules) and **context management** (lean instructions). Lotus handles both. You handle building your product.

## 🚀 Zero-Foundation Quick Start (For Beginners)

Never used terminal commands? No problem.
If you are starting a new project or setting up a brand-new computer, simply **copy and paste the following prompt** directly into your AI assistant (e.g., Cursor, Claude, Antigravity) and it will handle the entire installation for you!

> "This is a brand new project. Please execute the following initialization steps locally:
> 1. Clone `https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus.git` into a temporary directory in the system.
> 2. Determine my OS. Run the installer inside the temporary repo to apply the `nextjs` template to my current directory (Windows: `install.ps1 -Project nextjs`, Mac/Linux: `install.sh --project nextjs`).
> 3. To make sure you retain our workflows globally on this new machine, also run the global install flag (Windows: `install.ps1 -Global`, Mac/Linux: `install.sh --global`).
> 4. Once finished, delete the temporary cloned repository.
> 5. Carefully read the newly generated `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/` in my current directory to understand my coding standards and design language. Let me know when you are ready."

*(Note: Change `nextjs` to `vite` or `html` depending on your project type).*

### What about future new projects?

Once globally installed, Lotus core rules (workflows, quality gates) are **already active** in all your AI tools — **no wake-up needed**.

If you want to add **project-level templates** (design systems, tech stack constraints) to a new project, just run once inside the project folder:

```powershell
# Windows
C:\Dev\Lotus\install.ps1 -Project nextjs
```
```bash
# macOS / Linux
~/Dev/Lotus/install.sh --project nextjs
```

That's it. Global rules are always on; project templates layer on top as needed.

## 🔌 Manual Installation

### Step 0: Clone Lotus to a permanent home

Pick a directory where Lotus will live permanently (you'll `git pull` here for updates):

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus.git C:\Dev\Lotus
```
**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus.git ~/Dev/Lotus
```

### Step 1: Global Installation (Configure all your IDEs)

This injects Lotus rules into the global config of every supported AI tool on your machine.

> ⚠️ **Safe by design**: If you already have existing config files (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.aider.conf.yml`), the installer will automatically create `.bak` backups before overwriting. You can always restore them.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
C:\Dev\Lotus\install.ps1 -Global
```
**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
~/Dev/Lotus/install.sh --global
```

### Step 2: New Project Initialization (Optional)

Inside your empty new project folder, inject your preferred technology stack template:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourName\Projects\MyNewApp
C:\Dev\Lotus\install.ps1 -Project nextjs
```
**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/MyNewApp
~/Dev/Lotus/install.sh --project nextjs
```

*(Available templates: `nextjs`, `vite`, `html`)*

## 🎯 Tool Wake-Up Mechanisms (Skills)

You do not need to memorize complicated prompts; just remember a few simple commands. You can dynamically **wake up** specific expert personas exactly when you need them.

> 💡 **Why so few?** We deliberately keep the skill count small. Every skill here has survived months of real-world iteration across dozens of production projects. If a skill doesn't consistently deliver value, it gets **removed**, not "deprecated". Quality over quantity, always.

**How to Wake Them Up:**
The trigger syntax depends on whether you are using a visual IDE or a command-line agent:
* **For GUI IDEs (Cursor / Windsurf)**: Use the slash command `/name` (e.g., `/gstack`).
* **For CLI Agents (Claude Code / Antigravity / Aider)**: Use the mention format `@name` (e.g., `@gstack`).

### Available Wakes:

#### Lotus Original Skills (Cross-Platform)

1. **[`@gstack` / `/gstack`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/gstack.md)**
   * **What it does**: Triggers the elite multi-role developer workflow. The AI will explicitly switch between Product Manager, Architect, Builder, and QA before writing code to ensure system integrity.
2. **[`@feynman` / `/feynman`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/feynman.md)**
   * **What it does**: Forces the AI to use the Feynman Technique. It will break down and explain complex bugs or mechanisms using absolute layman terms before attempting a fix.
3. **[`@polanyi-tacit` / `/polanyi-tacit`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/polanyi-tacit.md)**
   * **What it does**: Wakes up a deeply analytical mode. The AI deliberately looks for architectural compromises, "defensive" code blocks, and unspoken organizational debt hidden behind the scenes.
4. **[`@auto-build` / `/auto-build`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/auto-build.md)**
   * **What it does**: Silently performs `npm install`, runs `npm run build`, and checks for compilation errors without asking for your permission.
5. **[`@btw` / `/btw`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/btw.md)**
   * **What it does**: Side-channel quick question mode. Inspired by Claude Code's native `/btw` command. Ask a quick question mid-task without interrupting your main workflow. The AI answers in 3-5 sentences, modifies zero files, and seamlessly returns to the primary task. Works across all platforms.

#### Adapted from Claude Code Native Commands (Lotus ports to other platforms)

The following commands are originally exclusive to the Claude Code CLI. Lotus distills their **core behavioral logic** into skill files so users on other platforms can get a similar experience.

6. **[`@powerup` / `/powerup`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/powerup.md)**
   * **When to use**: You're new to AI coding, or feel you're only using 10% of your AI's capabilities.
   * **What it does**: Think of it as the "Duolingo" for Claude Code — **10 structured lessons**, each ~2 minutes, covering everything from "how to talk to your codebase" and "how to undo AI changes", to advanced topics like "background tasks", "making AI remember your preferences", "creating sub-agents", and "remote control from your phone". Every lesson is a highlight reel curated by Anthropic. Instead of scattered tutorials, just power through all 10 levels. In Claude Code, type `/powerup`; on other platforms, trigger `@powerup` for an equivalent text-based walkthrough.
7. **[`@insights` / `/insights`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/insights.md)**
   * **When to use**: You've been using AI coding for a while and want to see what habits you can optimize.
   * **What it does**: Generates an interactive HTML report of your **past 30 days** of AI coding habits — your most-used commands, repetitive patterns, friction points, and areas where you get stuck in debugging loops. It even recommends custom commands and Skills to eliminate those bottlenecks. **This is looking back at your journey — incredibly rewarding!** In Claude Code, type `/insights`; on other platforms, trigger `@insights` for AI to perform a similar retrospective review of your project's conversation history.
8. **[`@loop` / `/loop`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/loop.md)**
   * **When to use**: You have recurring check tasks (e.g., poll deployment status every 5 minutes, monitor PR changes).
   * **What it does**: Sets up an in-session recurring task. Provide an interval and an instruction (e.g., `/loop 5m check deployment status`), and the AI acts like a little alarm clock, auto-executing on schedule. The loop is session-scoped — close the terminal and it stops. No system-level daemon, completely safe and controllable. In Claude Code, use `/loop <interval> <instruction>`; on other platforms, trigger `@loop` and the AI will simulate periodic reminders using platform-native capabilities.
9. **[`@subagent` / `/subagent`](https://github.com/Bronc-X/Lotus/blob/main/skills/subagent.md)**
   * **When to use**: Your task is too complex for one AI to handle, or you want AI to work on multiple things in parallel.
   * **What it does**: Create and manage **Subagents**. Each subagent has its own context window, system prompt, and tool permissions. You can have one subagent dedicated to searching the codebase, another running tests, while the main agent focuses on core logic — zero interference. This is the ultimate solution for "context window overflow": isolate noise into subprocess agents, keep the main thread clean. In Claude Code, use `/agents` to manage; on other platforms, trigger `@subagent` and the AI will guide you through task decomposition and context isolation.

## 🛡️ Safety

Lotus touches your global IDE config files. We take this seriously:

- **Auto-Backup**: Before overwriting any existing file (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.aider.conf.yml`, etc.), the installer automatically creates a `.bak` backup in the same directory. Nothing is silently lost.
- **Read-Only Rules**: Lotus only writes static Markdown files to config directories. It does **not** install executables, daemons, browser extensions, or background processes.
- **No Network Calls**: The install scripts run entirely offline. No telemetry, no analytics, no outbound requests. The only network operation is `git clone` / `git pull`, which you control.
- **Fully Reversible**: To completely uninstall Lotus, simply delete the injected files (e.g., `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`) or restore from the `.bak` backups. There is no registry, no system service, nothing hidden.

## 🔄 Update Philosophy

Lotus is **not a "set and forget" config**. It is a living, evolving protocol.

- **Primary tracking targets**: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and battle-tested open-source agent frameworks from top contributors.
- **What we track**: New global rule injection mechanisms, safer permission models, improved context-window strategies, and proven workflow patterns.
- **What we discard**: Hype-driven features, unstable APIs, and anything that adds complexity without measurable value.
- **The first-principles filter**: Before any new pattern is adopted, we ask: *Does this help vectors lock on more accurately? Does this reduce context waste?* If neither, it doesn't go in.
- **How to stay current**: Simply `git pull` and re-run the installer. Your global rules across all IDEs will be refreshed in seconds.

```bash
# Stay up to date in one command
cd /path/to/Lotus && git pull && ./install.sh --global
```
```powershell
# Windows equivalent
cd C:\path\to\Lotus; git pull; .\install.ps1 -Global
```

## 📌 Persistence: Set Up Once, Apply Forever

Once Lotus is installed globally, **every new project you create automatically inherits your rules**. No copy-pasting. No "remember to add the config file". The rules live at the OS-level global config of each AI tool, so they are always active—whether you're starting a fresh Next.js app, debugging a legacy codebase, or pair-programming on a colleague's machine.

For project-specific overrides (design systems, tech stacks), just use `install.ps1 -Project <template>` to layer on top. The global rules remain untouched.
