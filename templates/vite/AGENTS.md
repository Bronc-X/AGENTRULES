## Tech Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS (Styling)
- Zustand (State management)

## Design Language

- Refer to `.agents/rules/design-system.md` for exact color values and constraints.
- Avoid raw CSS unless necessary; use utility classes.

## Development Constraints

- Build commands: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`
- Always verify build after significant changes.
